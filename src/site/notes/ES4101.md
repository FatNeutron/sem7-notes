# Inverse Theory

**Inverse theory**, involves using mathematical techniques to solve problems where we only have the results or outcomes of a system, but not the details about how it works. It's like trying to figure out the cause of something by looking at its effects. In math, this often involves equations where we have to work backwards, starting with observed data, and then apply algorithms or methods to estimate the unknown factors. The goal is to find the best possible explanation or model that matches the data we have.

*Forward problem:*
model parameters ⟶ model ⟶prediction of data

*Inverse problem:*
data ⟶ model ⟶ estimate of model parameters

## Describing Inverse Problem

Let's assume a model with these linear equations,

$$
x_1 + x_2 = 1
$$
$$
x_1 - x_2 = 2
$$
we can express this in matrix form as, 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
 

We define matrices,

data: $d = \begin{bmatrix} d_1 \\ d_2 \\ d_3 \\ \vdots \\ d_N \end{bmatrix}$ , for $N$ number of data obtained.
model parameters: $m = \begin{bmatrix} m_1 \\ m_2 \\ m_3 \\ \vdots \\ m_M \end{bmatrix}$ , when $M$ number of info is available.
