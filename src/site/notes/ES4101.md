Structural geology studies the structural and arrangement of rocks at scales ranging from submicroscopic minerals to large regions and entire mountains belts. It explains how rocks respond to tectonic forces.

**Principle of Original Horizontality:** Sedimentary layers are deposited horizontally. Any tilting indicates post-depositional deformation.

**Types of Deformations:** Translation (movement), rotational (orientation), stain (shape/size change).

**Geological Structures:** 
- Primary Structure -> Form ***during*** rock formations 
	- Serves as markers to determine tectonic structures.
- Secondary Structure -> Form ***after*** rock formations

**Scale**
- Macroscale -> Features which can be traced over a region encompassing several outcrops to whole mountain ranges.
- Mesoscale -> Features which are visible in rock outcrops but can't necessarily be traced from outcrop to outcrop.
- Microscale -> Microscopic features which can be seen in microscope.

# Fold Geometry

Fold -> Structural feature formed when rocks are bend or curved.

- **Hinge line:** Locus of all points  with max curvature.
- **Hinge surface:**  Surface formed by multiple hinge lines of successive folded surface within in a single fold. (If surface is planer then it's **hinge plane.**) 
- **Hinge zone:** Area near the hinge line where surface has a relatively small radius of curvature.
- **Fold axis:** When the shape of fold can be generated by moving a line parallel to itself in space. This imaginary straight line, parallel to axis of the cylinder is **Fold axis.**
- **Limb:** Area of the folded surface between hinge zone where the the surface has a large radius of curvature.
- **Inflection line:** Line where surface change from convex to concave.
- **Enveloping surface:** Two limiting surfaces between where a fold oscillates.
- **Median surface:** Surface passing through inflection lines between successive folds in fold train.
- **Amplitude:** Half of perpendicular distance between enveloping surfaces.
- **Wavelength:** Distance from a point on on fold to the equivalent point on next fold.

- **Crest line:** Line on folded surface where the dip changes direction. Dip direction on either side of this line points away from each other. (Highest  elevation on a fold.)
- **Crest surface:** Surface formed by multiple crest lines of successive folded surface within a single fold. (If surface is planer then it's **crest plane**)

- **Trough line:** Line on folded surface where the dip changes its direction w.r.t horizontal reference frame; dip towards each other

- **Reference circle:** circle which is tangent to two inflection points.
>[!NOTE]
>Hinge zone is when, curvature > reference circle
>Limbs is when, curvature < referencecircle
